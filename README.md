# Power-BI-Projects

I built a dashboard of sales based on the dataset that I found in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

I preprocessed the data in SQL Management Studio and then connected that database to Power Bi.

In this repository you'll find the original files, the sql code I used to clean and preprocess the data, as well as the sql code I wrote to get some insights from the data.

Finally you'll find a pdf file with images of the dashboard, but in order to be able to interact with it you can go to this url: https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTZiYmIzN2MtYjcyNy00YzMzLWFkNmEtN2JlMzQwOTIwNGViIiwidCI6IjI2NWYyZTI2LWI4YTctNDE0Yy1iMjhjLTdlNTMyNDllMTAxMSIsImMiOjR9
