# Power-BI-and-TSQL-Projects

I built a dashboard of sales based on the dataset that I found in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

I preprocessed the data in SQL Management Studio and then connected that database to Power Bi.

In this repository you'll find the the sql code I used to clean and preprocess the data, as well as the sql code I wrote to get some insights from the data. I could upload all but one of the original files, because it was too big for Github, the one missing is the geolocation one, but you can see it on the kaggle link I provided a few lines above.

Finally, you'll find a pdf file with images of the dashboard, but in order to be able to interact with it you can go to this url: https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTZiYmIzN2MtYjcyNy00YzMzLWFkNmEtN2JlMzQwOTIwNGViIiwidCI6IjI2NWYyZTI2LWI4YTctNDE0Yy1iMjhjLTdlNTMyNDllMTAxMSIsImMiOjR9
